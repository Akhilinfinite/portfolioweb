                I am a software developer with a year of work experience and a
                strong passion for coding. I hold a B-Tech degree from GITAM
                Deemed to be University, where I have honed my technical skills
                in C, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and ReactJS.
              </p>
              <p className="AboutP">
                Additionally, I possess basic knowledge of Spring Boot and
                NodeJS, and I have experience working with DB tools like MySQL
                Workbench and MongoDB. I am proficient in Windows operating
                systems and skilled in using MS Office, particularly Excel and
                Spreadsheets.
              </p>
              <p className="AboutP">
                Apart from my technical expertise, I actively participate in
                co-curricular activities, including inter-house sports
                competitions and chess tournaments. I have also had the
                opportunity to conduct chess tournaments on behalf of Rotaract,
                showcasing my leadership skills. Outside of work, my hobbies
                include playing chess and listening to music.
              </p>
              <p className="AboutP">
                In terms of projects, I have worked on various web development
                projects. Notably, Deccan Pavilion, a restaurant food ordering
                website, and Friend Book, a social media web application, were
                part of my internship. I also undertook a ReactJS Practice
                project to further improve my frontend skills. Currently, I am
                actively working on a restaurant website, which involves
                converting a college project into a fully functioning frontend
                project.
